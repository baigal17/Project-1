# Cryto-Project Rough Draft

## Premise
---
Our group was planning on performing a meta-analysis of all crytocurrency behavior from 2017 until present day. We plan to source all of our data from Alpaca, clean it with Pandas, and graph our results using the pyviz ecosystem. Key metrics we will be analyzing may include: 

### Meta-Analysis Research Questions to be Answered
*How have all cryptocurrencies performed relative to each other over time?*

1. Average[^1] price
2. Average volatility
3. Average return
4. Average marketcap
5. Average liquidity

[^1]: All averages will be performed over user selected cryptocurrencies, potentially weighted by market cap.

### Datasets to be used
All data will be pulled from Alpaca.

### Next steps
- [x] Contact other group members 
- [x] Assuming they like it, begin wireframing/blueprinting the project
- [ ] Assign roles

### Roles
Visualizations: Spencer Shipp and Becca
Analysis: Tommy and Hadil

### Vizualizations
Line graphs, geoviz inspired graphics, Monte Carlo projections for every cryptocurrency in our scope.

### User CLI 
- [ ] View analysis results as CLI printouts, as distinct from Vizualizations 30K foot graphics

### Analysis Milestones
- [ ] Working CLI that accepts user input
- [ ] Grabbing relevant data from Alpaca APIs
- [ ] Cleaning data
- [ ] Analyze it based on desired metrics
- [ ] Pass the analyzed to Viz team

### Vizualizations Milestones
- [ ] Finalize desired vizualizations
- [ ] Finalize dependency list (Monte Carlo, Pyviz Dependencies) requirements.txt
- [ ] Select sample data frame to use until real data is acquired
