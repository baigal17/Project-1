# Cryto-Project Rough Draft

## Premise
---
Our group was planning on performing a meta-analysis of all crytocurrency behavior from 2017 until present. We plan to source all of our data from Alpaca, clean it with Pandas, and graph our results using the pyviz ecosystem. Key metrics we will be analyzing may include: 

### Research Questions to be Answered
*How have cryptocurrencies performed over time? Is it possible to responsibly maintain a portfolio of purely cryptocurrency?*

1. Average[^1] price
2. Average volatility
3. Average return
4. Average marketcap
5. Average liquidity

[^1]: All averages will be performed over all cryptocurrencies, potentially weighted by market cap.

### Datasets to be used
All data will be pulled from Alpaca.

### Next steps

- [ ] Assuming they like it, begin wireframing/blueprinting the project
